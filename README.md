# Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to utilize data analytics to identify the optimal playing 11 for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022. This involved collecting data from the ESPN Cricinfo website, processing it using Python and Pandas, and creating interactive dashboards with Power BI for insightful visualizations.

# Key Steps:

1.Web Scraping Data from ESPN Cricinfo:

Employed the third-party web scraper "Bright Data" to gather comprehensive information from ESPN Cricinfo, including match details, results, and player statistics for batting and bowling.  
   Stored the extracted data in JSON format for subsequent processing.

2.Data Transformation and Conversion:

Used Python and Pandas to convert the JSON data into CSV format.
Ensured the data was appropriately formatted for direct use in Power BI, facilitating easier table joining and analysis.

3.Power BI Dashboard Creation:

  Utilized Power Query in Power BI to further clean and prepare the data for analysis.
  Developed dynamic dashboards featuring interactive charts and visualizations, showcasing metrics for different player 
  roles such as power hitters, middle-order batsmen, and bowlers.
  These dashboards delivered valuable insights into player performance, team strengths, and potential areas for improvement.

4.Forming the Best Playing 11:
